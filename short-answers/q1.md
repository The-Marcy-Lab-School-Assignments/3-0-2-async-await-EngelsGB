# Question

Using `async`/`await` over `.then`/`.catch` makes our code for handling promises much more readable. What are the ways in which `async`/`await` is more readable than `.then` and `.catch`?

# Answer

`async`/`await` is more readable than `.then`/`.catch` because it allows us to write code in a more synchronous-like manner. This means the code will be more straightforward and linear, keeping a single style or flow, and being easier to follow.
