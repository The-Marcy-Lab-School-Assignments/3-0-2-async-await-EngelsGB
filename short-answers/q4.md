# Question

Is this function safe? Why or why not?

```js
const getUser = async (userId) => {
  const url = `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/${userId}`;
  const response = await fetch(url);
  const users = await response.json();
  console.log(users);
  return users;
};
getUser(-1);
```

Again, running the code gives you the answer, so try to figure it out on your own first!

# Answer

This function is not safe to run as it cannot handle errors from the fetch, also that calling it with a negative integer as argument will give either an error, null, undefined or an empty object. Furthermore, considering that the function fetches a response from an url using the integer as an identification number to get an specific user, it's most likely that the smallest id number is 0 or 1.
